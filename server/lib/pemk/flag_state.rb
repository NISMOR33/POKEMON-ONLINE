  #
  # The client pushes the WHOLE non-default set as an absolute snapshot (the `:inv`
  # pattern: reconnect-safe, self-healing, last_seq high-water dedup). We RECORD it and
  # flag a REWIND, but never reject: the save blob stays authoritative until the
  # world-vs-player ID partition is decided (a game-design call, not an engineering one).
  #
  # WHAT COUNTS AS A REWIND — calibrated to avoid punishing honest play:
  #   * self-switches that were ON and are now OFF => THE signal. A self-switch is the
  #     engine's "this one-shot event has happened" marker; vanilla event scripts set
  #     them and effectively never clear them, so a batch of them going OFF is a save
  #     rollback, and it is exactly what re-farms NPC gifts / TMs / key items. The
  #     manifest's latched and repeatable self-switches are cleared by the game
  #     itself, so they are left out of the count.
  #   * switches going OFF and variables DECREASING are RECORDED but NOT flagged:
  #     both legitimately happen all the time (temp flags, countdowns, counters reset
  #     by events), so judging them would flood the queue with honest players.
  # A single self-switch clearing is tolerated (some games do reset one deliberately);
