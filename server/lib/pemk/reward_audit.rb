  # M4 Layer D D4: wild-battle reward WINDOWS. When the client reports a wild battle's
  # end (:battle_end — outcome + the foes it fought), a per-account budget window opens:
  # how much EXP the party could have legitimately gained (RewardCalc envelope) and how
  # much money could have moved (Pay Day gain / blackout loss). Subsequent money deltas
  # and level jumps are checked against — and consume — the window:
  #
  #   money  in-window & within budget  -> ledger reason "battle:<n>" (attribution)
  #          in-window but OVER budget  -> "battle_suspect:<n>" + a SUSPECT log
  #          no window                  -> "unattributed" (shops/trades are normal)
  #   levels jump needs more exp than the window holds -> SUSPECT log (detection-only,
  #          it NEVER rejects). Level items used outside battles (Rare Candy, the Exp.
  #          Candies) are credited from the bag snapshots first, so using them is not
  #          suspect; where the items came from is the inventory audit's question.
  #
  # ATTRIBUTION vs SUSPICION: money attribution (`battle:<n>` / `unattributed`) is written
  # to the append-only ledger, so it must stay CLEAN — a suspicious over-budget delta is
  # still attributed to its battle window and the *suspicion* is a returned flag the caller
  # LOGS (never a ledger label). A money DECREASE is a spend/loss, never a reward cheat, so
  # it is never suspect.
  #
  # THREADING: called from BOTH the reactor thread (record_battle, check_levels) and worker
  # threads (note_money, via the PlayerMailbox), so all @windows access is under @mutex.
