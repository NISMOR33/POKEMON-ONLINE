  # Item authority E2: every increase of an item the player possesses must be explained by
  # a source the server knows.
  #
  # The possession is the bag, the PC storage, the mailbox and the held items together
  # (E0 keeps them in one record), so moving an item between them changes nothing here.
  # A decrease - an item used, sold, tossed, handed to an NPC - is the client's business
  # and always accepted. An increase takes the account's credits for that item, oldest
  # first. A credit is what a source left: a pickup the server granted, a gift it paid, a
  # purchase it made, the item a traded Pokemon brought.
  #
  # A source can also be heard after the increase it explains (a pickup reported once its
  # message closed, while the bag went out during the message), so what no credit covers
  # becomes a debt that a credit arriving within its grace pays. A debt still open then is
  # an unexplained increase. Rows: qty > 0 is a credit, qty < 0 a debt.
  #
  # Enforcement (E4): a debt past its grace is not dropped but kept OWED - the client is
  # asked to take its units back - until they leave the possession: a decrease settles
  # the item's open debts first, owed then pending. A late credit pays a pending debt,
  # never an owed one (its correction may already be applied).
