  #
  # Per account, S - the balance M2 would keep: the prizes it would pay, the server's
  # own deals, the spends - and C - the client's balance as the server last knew it. A
  # fresh money frame of value v logs what no source explains and was not already above
  # S: max(0, v - S) - max(0, C - S); then S = min(S, v) and C = v. The excess is derived
  # each time, never kept, so a conjure after a spend, or back up to an old peak, is
  # logged again. S is never floored: a purchase S cannot cover is logged as such.
  #
  # A row is seeded at the account's first claim, deal or frame with the measurement on,
  # from the ledger balance before that event applies - the start money when the ledger
  # has no row yet (a new account's login seed is its starting money, not a gain).
  # Every call runs on the account's mailbox, or inside its deal's transaction.
