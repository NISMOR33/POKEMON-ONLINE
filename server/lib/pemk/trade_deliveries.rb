  # A traded Pokemon is safe only once a save that holds it lands. The swap is the
  # registry's (Trades), but the Pokemon itself travels client to client, so a receiver
  # that died before that save - or never got the trade's result - lost it for good.
  #
  # This keeps the body the partner locked, from the swap until then:
  #   stored   in the swap's own transaction
  #   acked    when the client reports it in its party or a box (:trade_applied)
  #   dropped  by the first save after that report (TCP keeps the order, so that save
  #            holds it)
  # Whatever is still held when the receiver authenticates is sent again
  # (:trade_redeliver). The client adds the Pokemon only when its uid is not already
  # there, so a repeat is harmless. A fresh login un-acks what no save sealed: the save
  # it loads cannot hold it.
