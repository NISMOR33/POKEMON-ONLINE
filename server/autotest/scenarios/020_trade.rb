# Two players on one map trade a Pokemon each through the pause menu. The server
# swaps the owners in one transaction: each window must end up with the other's
# Pokemon under the same server uid, the registry must agree, and a relaunch (from
# the save the trade forces) must keep it that way. The escrow is checked on its way
# (PEMK_PEER_CHECK on): an honest Pokemon passes the server and the client.
