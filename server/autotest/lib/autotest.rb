# Autotest: plays the real game against an isolated server and reports.
#
# Each scenario gets its own in-process PEMK server (test port, the pemk_autotest
# database, the scenario's flags) and as many game windows as it asks for. The
# windows are ordinary debug launches driven through the autopilot's file channel
# (Plugins/PEMK/011_Autopilot); they run minimized, on fresh accounts created by
# the login's config shortcut. Every wait is bounded, every scenario has a budget
# enforced by a watchdog, and a failure is written up with the state, a screenshot
# and the logs of everything involved.
