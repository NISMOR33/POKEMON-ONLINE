# PEMK :: PrizeClaim  (client side — money authority M1a: trainer prizes claimed)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A trainer battle's prize is claimed where the engine pays it (Battle#pbGainMoney),
# just before the engine adds it. The claim names each trainer by the data it was built
# from and the event that started its battle - both tagged when GameData::Trainer builds
# it (#to_trainer), so a rival's substituted name, and a trainer that spotted the player
# first and waited for a second one, keep theirs - with the amount the engine is about
# to pay and its multiplier facts (Amulet Coin, Happy Hour). The coins Pay Day scattered
# are claimed apart (M1c): a wild battle's name its foes, a trainer battle's its prize
# claim.
#
# The server judges it against the exports and records its verdict (money_claims at
# login; shadow only logs). A fresh position goes first, since the claim is judged by
# where the server last saw the player. The claim waits in the save until the server
# answers it, and goes out again on a new connection; the econ flush is held during
# battles, so it always reaches the server before the frame that shows its money.
